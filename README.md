# Generic Snake Game in JavaScript

This is my first attempt to create a simple project using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.

To test the game out, simply open the [**preview**](https://honkou-simple-snake-game.netlify.app/) in a browser.

The idea to use a css grid instead of a canvas element was strongly inspired by [WDS's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY&t=2372s).

As this is very much a test project, all feedback, regarding both coding as well as Netlify and GIT usage, is welcome.
