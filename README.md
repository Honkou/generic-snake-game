# Generic Snake Game in JavaScript

This is my first attempt to create a simple project using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.

To test the game out, simply open the [**snake.html**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Honkou/generic-snake-game/blob/main/snake.html) file in a browser.

The idea to use a css grid instead of a canvas element was strongly inspired by [WDS's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY&t=2372s).

As this is very much a test project, all feedback, regarding both coding and GIT usage, is welcome.
